### GERS Registry

How do I know if a UUID is a GERS ID?

- Look it up in the GERS Registry: **Official Record** of every ID ever released
  - Is the ID present in the latest release?
  - What was the last release that contained this ID?

- Enables GERS ID based search: Where the feature can be found both geographically and in the file.
