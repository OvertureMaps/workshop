The [Overture Maps Foundation](//overturemaps.org) is an open data project within the Linux Foundation that aims to "Power current and next-generation map products by creating reliable, easy-to-use, and interoperable open map data."

Primarily, "Overture is for developers who build map services or use geospatial data." Additionally, Overture is a fantastic resource for researchers looking to work with one of the most complete and computationally efficient open geospatial datasets.
